***** UPDATE: I DON'T USE VOSTRO 3568 ANYMORE SINCE I WAS CHANGED TO XPS 13 2020. I STILL UPDATE THE EFI EVERYDAY WHEN IT COME STABLE. *****


OpenCore 0.6.1 for Vostro 3568.

This is a OpenCore-based EFI for Dell Vostro 3568. REMEMBER: THIS IS THE ALPHA VERSION. YOU MIGHT FACE BUG WHILE USING.

I'm using a Vostro 3568 i3 version.

About the specs:
 
 + CPU: Intel Core i3-7020u 2.3GHz
 + RAM: 4GB DDR4 2133Mhz
 + SSD: 240GB HP S400 SATA3 SSD
 + Display 1366x768
 + Audio: Realtek ALC256 Audio Controller
 + Intel Dual Band AC-3165
 + Realtek RTL8111

 + Since I hasn't fix the graphics yet. You need to use OpenCore with my Clover framebuffer patch or the patch I'm following on Dortania OpenCore Guide.
